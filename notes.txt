a person should be able to purchase a ticket to a show
they should be able to attend the show
they should be able to attend multiple shows

we should keep track of how many used tickets a person has
we should be able to use a ticket (go to a show)

where do we pass in the date of the concert

if we want to simulate tickets being used and going to the concert
how can we change todays date?

what if we wanted tickets to work with different types of objects
